The only file you need to get the editor up and running is DromEd.zip.
You need to unzip it in a pre-existing Thief 2 install directory 
(for example C:\games\thief2 - or wherever you have installed Thief 2).
When you unzip dromed.zip, you will be asked if you want to
overwrite some files, answer "Yes to all". This will insure that all of 
your config files are set up right.  You will need a Thief 2 CD to get 
all of the resources - the art, sound, mesh & mocap files.  You will also
find a subdirectory on CD 1 in editor\docs.  You can find a 
tutorial and some other DromEd reference files can be found there.

If you want to see some examples of pre-existing levels or you want to 
change one of the levels that shipped with Thief 2 you can unzip the
relevant mission files in this directory.  These missions are zipped
up in missions.zip.  Please not that these are special versions of the
mission files.  When we shipped Thief 2 we "stripped" some information
that only the editor uses out of the mission files in order to make them
smaller and save space on the CD and your hard drive.  If you want to edit
a mission file from Thief 2 you have to use one of the files in this
directory.

It is also important to note that you should create a different directory
from your Thief 2 directory in which to place the "unstripped" mission
files.  If you unzip them in your Thief 2 directory you may experience
problems with potential future patches.
